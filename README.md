## What is OUOT

The University Observatory of Territorial Planning was born as an initiative of the Faculty of Space Sciences through the Master's program in Planning and Management of the Territory of the Faculty of Space Sciences, of the National Autonomous University of Honduras, to establish a management system of the knowledge and information on the subject of study and its application in the country.

This Geoportal, based on WebODM, is designed to facilitate access to the photogrammetric treatment of products derived from drones for the use of students of the careers of the Faculty of Space Sciences, of the National Autonomous University of Honduras. .
